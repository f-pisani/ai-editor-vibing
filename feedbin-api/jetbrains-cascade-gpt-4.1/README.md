# Feedbin API Go Client – Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This package provides a Go client for the Feedbin API, supporting authentication, pagination, and error handling using only the Go standard library.

## 2. Structure

- `client/` – Core HTTP client, authentication, request/response logic.
- `models/` – Data structures for entries, subscriptions, etc.
- `utils/` – Helpers (e.g., pagination, error handling).
- `README.md` – This plan and usage instructions.

## 3. Authentication

- HTTP Basic Auth using username (email) and password.
- Credentials set via the `Authorization` header.

## 4. Endpoints to Support

- Authentication check (`GET /v2/authentication.json`)
- Entries (`GET /v2/entries.json`) – supports pagination
- Pages (`POST /v2/pages.json`)
- Subscriptions (`GET /v2/subscriptions.json`, `GET /v2/subscriptions/{id}.json`, `PATCH /v2/subscriptions/{id}.json`)

## 5. Pagination

- Entries endpoint is paginated.
- Expose pagination parameters and results in the client.

## 6. Error Handling

- Non-2xx responses returned as errors.
- Log details for failed requests.

## 7. Usage

- Instantiate client with credentials.
- Use client methods to interact with API endpoints.
